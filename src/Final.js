                    In summary, Plan B is the optimal pricing model to go
                    forward with. Although Plan B has smaller short-term
                    revenue, itâ€™s long-term revenue greatly surpasses Plan A by
                    the end of 2020. This goes hand-in-hand with one of our key
                    priorities, which is to prioritize long-term revenue over
                    short-term.
                    <div>&nbsp;</div>
                    It is hard to say which Plan will result in providing our
                    consumer with the best experience (more listings). To figure
                    this out, I would like to launch an A/B test in two similar
                    geographical locations: one for Plan A and one for Plan B. I
                    would measure how each Plan fluctuates the number of
                    listings from both customer segments: small and big home
                    builders (see how I would define 'big' or 'small' below). If
                    the total combined number of listings is greater for Plan B,
                    then I would roll out Plan B to the whole Zillow platform
                    (as Plan B has won on both business objectives). If the
                    total combined number of listings is greater for Plan A,
                    therefore conflicting with Plan Bâ€™s win on revenue, I would
                    investigate with the data on who is advertising on Plan A
                    that is not advertising on Plan B. Then pass on my research
                    with the team so we can strategize.
                    <div>&nbsp;</div>
                    From a strategic standpoint, Plan B better allows us to
                    monetize based on our current business goal. Phase I of
                    Zillowâ€™s mission statement was to help people start their
                    search on a new home. Phase II, and the current phase, is to
                    help people finish their search on a new home. This means
                    that as we develop more tools for our consumers to finish
                    their home searches, the more inclined a consumer will be to
                    use Zillow to contact a builder or create leads.
                    <div>&nbsp;</div>
                    Plan B allows us to control monetization, unlike plan A.
                    With Plan B we can figure out ways to increase leads through
                    new features such as a reworked UI. With Plan B, we do not
                    control the builder. We cannot tell them to build more
                    communities to help us generate more revenue.
                    <div>&nbsp;</div>I hypothesize that Plan A attracts bigger
                    and more established home builders as their number of leads
                    will surpass the cost of the flat community charge. However,
                    Plan Aâ€™s high upfront cost may create a paywall that might
                    repel smaller home builders. On the inverse, I hypothesize
                    that Plan B attracts smaller home builders because it is the
                    cheaper alternative. However, Plan B disadvantages bigger
                    and more established home builders with a large number of
                    leads that surpass the breakeven point of Plan B (10
                    leads/month). Using the A/B test above, I would add these
                    metrics:
                    <div>&nbsp;</div>
                    <ol>
                      <li>
                        Number of builders advertising (per month/per year)
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Drop off rate of advertising (builders are no longer
                        interested in advertising with us)
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Newly acquired advertisements (builders who havenâ€™t
                        advertised with us before)
                      </li>
                    </ol>
                    This would gauge whether or not builders like our model, and
                    if they prefer other models over the others. I hypothesize
                    that Plan B will still result in more revenue and more
                    listings because bigger home builders have more capital to
                    play with - therefore able to afford the higher cost per
                    lead instead of per community. To add, I also hypothesize
                    that Plan B will be able to capture more smaller home
                    builders, as Plan B is a more affordable option than Plan A.
                    Using the A/B test laid out above and metrics I have set, I
                    will be able to determine if my hypothesis is correct or
                    not.

                                  advertising less than the total number of
                                  bigger home builders (because of capital
                                  reasons). I also assumed that bigger
                                  homebuilders (who are winners of Plan A) that
                                  receive above average leads per community,
                                  will be willing to adopt to this model.

                    Firstly, I would like to see the data on how many big
                    builders and smaller builders we are currently capturing
                    with advertising. I would first come up with a definition of
                    what it means to be either a â€˜bigâ€™ or â€˜smallâ€™ builder first:
                    by number of homes built per year or number of unique
                    communities (for example). From this, I would query data
                    based on definitions and see which segments are advertising
                    with Zillow, and which segments are not.
                    <div>&nbsp;</div>
                    Secondly, I would like to see the ratio of the number of
                    total new construction communities in relation to the number
                    that is currently on Zillow. What percent of new
                    construction communities are being advertised across all
                    communities in the US? This would give us our North Star:
                    what our profits could look like if we captured more new
                    construction communities. This data would also help us
                    understand segments we arenâ€™t hitting - so we can strategize
                    accordingly. To find this data, I would aggregate the total
                    amount of unique new construction communities currently
                    listed on Zillow. Then, I would find government census data
                    that tells me the total amount of permits issued and
                    aggregate that data to figure out how many communities a
                    builder has built.
